One day I felt this hatred |towards Germans|and I still feel ashamed
Somehow they deserve it|sometimes
We don't want a new Hitler|reigning over Europe
How can we trust|those from the south?
We need to share|all the same values
We need to keep our own|personality as a people
How can I tolerate you|if you're so different?
How can I find you appealing|if you're so similar? 
Stronger together
Safer alone
We want to recover|our autonomy
We want to travel free
We don't even speak|the same language
I love speaking|your language
